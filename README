NAME
    Net::DomainTools::API - Base class for the Domain Tools API

SYNOPSIS
     use base qw( Net::DomainTools::API );

     sub _init {
        my( $self ) = @_;
        ${ $self->{default_params} }{'application'} = 'search_engine';
     };

DESCRIPTION
    This is a base class for the Domain Tools API. It should not be used
    directly.

    Subclasses will typically want to override things in the
    'default_params' hash.

    Items in this hash will be passed in as default values to the HTTP
    request and will be overridden if the same key is passed into the
    request() method.
